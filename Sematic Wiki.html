                <p>Hermaphrodites evolved several times independently in nematodes, probablly as adoptation to colonize new habitats by a single individual<br>
                The evolution of hermaproditism gave rise to other modes of reproduction in addition to diocey(male/female), such as androdiocey (male/hermaphrodite).<br>
                and trioecy (all of genitals), Nematode hermaphrodites can either reproduce for themselves as a self-fertilization or by mating with males.<br> Cause when the male sperm are able to outcompete the sperm of hermaprodites the genetic basis for evolutionary
                transitions between diocey and other kinds of reproduction were til recently unknown </p>
