		<h1 style="color:red">A man with a billion-dollar box office record answered the door for nobody.Instead he would have a uniformed man posted full-time at his front door.
			And his doorman would only allow me entrance after carefully checking my identification and appointment.</h1>
		<hr>
		<i>He Would then hand me off to a butler or the first floor maid,who walk me the rest of the way in,footsteps failing
			as silent as a snow soon as we pass by.
		</i>
		<hr>
		<b>But there was none of that at the mansion on Bel-Air Crest Road.The driveway gate had been left open. And after I parked in the front of a turnaround circle 
			and knocked on the door,it was the box-office champion himself who opened it and beckoned me into a home whose dimensions could have been copied directly
			from the international terminal at LAX.
